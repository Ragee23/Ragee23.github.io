            <p>Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of
            sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. The term is derived from
            Ancient Greek parallaxis, meaning 'alternation'. Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than
            farther objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.</p>

        <h3>How Parallax Works</h3>
        <p>Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras
        that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual
        fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is
        used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in
        some variations also altitude to a target.</p>
